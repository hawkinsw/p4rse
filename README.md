## P4RSE: P4 Runtime In Swift Environment

_P4SE_ (yes, the acronym is a bit forced) is a P4 parser and runtime written in Swift. The project was started as a means to better learn Swift.

### Status

Very, very alpha:

1. Limited parts of the language can be parsed.
2. Limited programs can be evaluated.
